#Since we’ve successfully installed Angular CLI , let’s executes 
#this command to build the Angular application in production mode. 
#The resulting output will be stored in the ‘dist’ directory.

#So basically with this command we starts a new stage in the Dockerfile,
#using the official Nginx image as the base image for the runtime environment.
# FROM nginx:1.25.1-alpine AS prod

#Copies the production-ready Angular application files from the build stage to 
#the `/usr/share/nginx/html`directory inside the Nginx container.
# COPY --from=build app/dist/aftas-angular /usr/share/nginx/html

#EXPOSE 80
