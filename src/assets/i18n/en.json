This parameter depends on the frequency and, therefore, two sound events with the same sound level, but different frequency do not always result in the same sensation of volume in the human ear. The unit of measurement is the “sone”, and through this parameter the human sensation of noise volume can be represented linearly.

The auditory sensation represented by roughness, which often produces a sensation of discomfort to the human ear, is related to loudness modulations at frequencies too high to be discerned separately (modulation frequencies higher than 30 Hz). The unit of measurement is the 'asper', and is defined as the roughness produced by a 60 dB 1000 Hz tone, which is 100% amplitude modulated at 70 Hz.",

        "content4": "Fluctuation strength is a parameter that quantifies the subjective perception of slower amplitude modulation (up to 20 Hz). Therefore, it is a concept similar to roughness but for low frequencies. The fluctuation force persists until approximately 20 Hz, from where a complex zone begins to be evaluated in terms of fluctuation force and roughness. This zone extends to frequencies of approximately 30 Hz, where roughness dominates subjective perception. The unit of measurement for fluctuation strength is the 'vacil', which is defined as the fluctuation strength produced by a 60 dB 1000 Hz tone that is 100% amplitude modulated at 4 Hz."
